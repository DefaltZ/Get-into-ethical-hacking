# Get-into-ethical-hacking
A comprehensive guide to start learning ethical hacking

***ETHICAL HACKING GUIDE***

there could be multiple ways for one to get started with ethical hacking/penetration testing(short: pentesting) with our without formal education in infosec/computer science, You can either utilise free resources on the internet or go for paid courses and professional certifications if you want to make it easier for yourself to enter the industry professionaly in the future. Going via general recommendations, the first step to self learning cybersecurity are:

**1. Learn Networking procedures**<br><br>
Networking is the most essential part of pentesting since using, designing exploits and exploring attack vectors all comes down to messing around with ports and the technologies that run them. Learn all about ports, IP ranges and common webservices.

**2. Programming**<br><br>
Its important for if you are learning pentesting to have decent programming knowledge to automate tasks, develop malware or make/modify exploits, the most frequently used languages by hackers are Python, Javascript, C/C++, and SQL.

**3. Using Linux**<br><br>
when it comes to learning pentesting, linux distros are the de facto OS you have to learn to use, because of their open sandboxing and inbuilt availability and support for tools related to pentesting. Its suggested you run a linux distro like kali, ubuntu or any distro of your choice as a VM while learning pentesting.

**4. Learning to use tools:**<br><br>
Tools are the different programs you will be using to "hack", these tools automate tasks that could take hours with manual programming to accomplish, distros like kali and blackarch rock around hundreds of these pre-installed tools which cover different areas of pentesting such as vulnerability scanning, exploitation, post-exploitation, reporting etc, the same tools can actually also be installed from github/arch repos on other distros such as ubuntu/arch where they are not pre-installed and used the exact same way. Knowing exactly how to use which tool and when is really determines your pentesting knowledge.

**4. Ethics:**<br><br>

The line that differentiates hacking from ethical hacking is the motive, Whitehats, blackhats, greyhats all use the same tools and same methods to penetrate a system, its the ethics that seperate them all into "hats" in the first place. As an ethical hacker you are penetrating the system, finding its weaknesses and exploiting them not for money or fun but a responsibility to secure the system for greater good, stay one step ahead of malicious actors who want to expose and use the same weaknesses and exploits as you but to give themselves a leverage and cause damage. Therefore reporting is an essential phase for ethical hackers to organise and report their findings for the developers and sysadmins to take care of. Cyber security is an ever-evolving war between men who want to watch the world burn and the ones who want to make the glue holding it together stronger.

**5. IT certifications:**<br><br>

IT certifications will be your way into the world of pentesting in a professional way, while IT certifications do not gurantee job placements out of the box, they highly increase your chances of getting hired, therefore it is important for you to choose what certification you will be pursuing carefully, certifications can be for learning pentesting as a whole(CEH, OSCP)or empowering your knowledge in parts of it(udemy certifications on webapp pentesting, exploit development etc.), certifications are written proof of your knowledge in the field and hereby hold a lot of value when looked after by recruiters, second only to work experience.

**6. Practice:**<br><br>

Hacking requires constant practice, therefore you must have a VM with your attacker and host machine OS set up for you to carry out attacks. Apart from that however there are online platforms with CTFs and intentionally vulnerable websites for you to practice attacks on without the need for a seperate target machine on your VM itself. Practicing on these platforms can actually help enhance your hands on knowledge on pentesting, its the most important thing while learning not just pentesting but any IT related discipline.
